# Transformer vs RNN: Why Transformers Reign Supreme

This README delves into the superiority of the transformer model over recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing tasks, particularly in the context of neural machine translation.

## The Problem with RNNs

RNNs process inputs sequentially, leading to computational bottlenecks as the sequence length increases. Longer sequences require more sequential steps, amplifying the risk of information loss and vanishing gradients.

## The Rise of Transformers

Transformers, born out of Google's efforts to address RNN limitations, revolutionize NLP with their attention-based architecture. Unlike RNNs, transformers rely solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the sequential processing bottleneck.

## Why Transformers Excel

Transformers offer unparalleled speed and robustness in handling complex contexts, thanks to their parallel computation capabilities and enhanced understanding of context.

## Next Steps

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into transformers, exploring their inner workings and concrete applications in natural language processing tasks.
