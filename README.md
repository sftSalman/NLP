# Transformer vs RNN: Why Transformers Reign Supreme

This README delves into the superiority of the transformer model over recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing tasks, particularly in the context of neural machine translation.

## The Problem with RNNs

RNNs process inputs sequentially, leading to computational bottlenecks as the sequence length increases. Longer sequences require more sequential steps, amplifying the risk of information loss and vanishing gradients.

## The Rise of Transformers

Transformers, born out of Google's efforts to address RNN limitations, revolutionize NLP with their attention-based architecture. Unlike RNNs, transformers rely solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the sequential processing bottleneck.

## Why Transformers Excel

Transformers offer unparalleled speed and robustness in handling complex contexts, thanks to their parallel computation capabilities and enhanced understanding of context.

# Understanding Transformers: A Brief Overview

Transformers have sparked immense interest and excitement in the field of natural language processing. This README provides a concise overview of the transformer model and its significance.

## Introduction to Transformers

The transformer model, introduced in 2017 by Google researchers, including Lukasz Kaiser, has emerged as the standard architecture for large language models. Notable examples include BERT, T5, and GPT-3, each contributing to the transformative impact of transformers in NLP.

The foundational paper, "Attention is All You Need," lays the groundwork for understanding transformers and serves as the basis for subsequent models explored in this course.

## Core Components of the Transformer Model

At the heart of the transformer model lies scale dot-product attention, a computationally efficient mechanism for capturing relationships between words in a sequence. This attention mechanism enables transformers to scale effectively, utilizing fewer computational resources compared to traditional architectures.

The transformer model employs multi-head attention layers, running in parallel and incorporating learnable linear transformations of input queries, keys, and values. This enables the model to capture complex dependencies within the input sequence.

## Encoder and Decoder Architecture

The transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder framework, each comprising multiple layers of attention modules, residual connections, and normalization.

- **Encoder**: Utilizes self-attention to generate contextual representations of input sequences, facilitating effective information capture across all input tokens.

- **Decoder**: Employs masked attention to attend only to previous positions during sequence generation, followed by attention to encoder outputs to ensure coherence between input and output sequences.

## Positional Encoding

Transformers incorporate positional encoding to encode the position of each input token within the sequence. This ensures that word order information is preserved, essential for tasks such as translation.

## Model Architecture

The transformer architecture combines input embeddings, positional encodings, encoder layers, and decoder layers to facilitate parallelized training and efficient computation across multiple GPUs.

## Advantages Over RNNs

Transformers address key limitations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including sequential processing bottlenecks and vanishing gradient problems. By leveraging parallel computation and attention mechanisms, transformers offer a promising alternative for processing sequential data in various domains.
