# Understanding Transformer Networks

The transformer network, also known as Transformers, has revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) with its innovative architecture. In the following series of videos, we'll dissect the transformer network step by step to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of its workings.

## Evolution from Sequential Models
- Started with RNNs but faced issues like vanishing gradients and difficulty capturing long-range dependencies.
- GRU and LSTM models were introduced to address these problems by incorporating gating mechanisms, but they increased model complexity.

## Introduction to Transformer Architecture
- Transformer architecture allows for parallel processing of entire sequences.
- Unlike sequential models, it can process the entire input sentence simultaneously, rather than one word at a time.
- Major innovation: combining attention-based representations with CNN-style processing.

### Key Contributors and Publication

### Core Concepts
- **Self-Attention**: Computes rich representations for each word in a sentence in parallel.
- **Multi-Headed Attention**: A loop over the self-attention process, resulting in multiple versions of representations.
- These representations are highly effective for various NLP tasks like machine translation.

##  Overview
1. **Self-Attention**: Exploring the computation of rich representations for words.
2. **Multi-Headed Attention**: Understanding the process of generating multiple representations.
3. **Integration**: Putting together the concepts of self-attention and multi-headed attention into the transformer architecture.

# Self-Attention Mechanism of Transformers

The self-attention mechanism is a fundamental component of transformer networks, enabling them to compute attention-based representations for each word in an input sentence. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

## Key Concepts
- **Attention Representation**: For each word in the input sentence, the goal is to compute an attention-based representation.
- **Query, Key, and Value**: Three vectors associated with each word, used to compute the attention value.
- **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, self-attention computes representations for all words in parallel.

## Computation Steps
1. **Query, Key, and Value Pairs**: Each word is associated with three values—query, key, and value—computed using learned matrices.
2. **Inner Product Calculation**: Compute the inner product between the query and key vectors to determine the relevance of each word.
3. **Softmax Operation**: Apply softmax to obtain attention weights, indicating the importance of each word in the context.
4. **Weighted Sum**: Multiply softmax values with corresponding value vectors and sum them up to obtain the attention-based representation.
5. **Result**: Each word now has a rich, context-aware representation, adapting based on surrounding words.

## Advantages
- **Dynamic Representations**: Enables the model to adapt word embeddings based on context, leading to richer representations.
- **Parallel Processing**: Computes representations for all words simultaneously, improving efficiency.

## Implementation Overview
- **Matrix Formulation**: Represented as Attention(Q, K, V), where Q, K, and V matrices contain query, key, and value vectors.
- **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Original attention mechanism used in transformer architecture papers.
# Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

The multi-head attention mechanism is an extension of the self-attention mechanism introduced in transformers, allowing the model to compute multiple attention-based representations in parallel. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

## Key Concepts
- **Heads**: Each computation of self-attention for a sequence is called a head.
- **Parallel Computation**: Multi-head attention involves calculating self-attention multiple times in parallel.

## Computation Steps
1. **Query, Key, and Value Pairs**: Same as in self-attention, each word is associated with query, key, and value vectors.
2. **Multiple Heads**: Calculate self-attention multiple times using different sets of weight matrices.
3. **Concurrent Processing**: Each head computes attention values independently, allowing for parallel computation.
4. **Concatenation**: Concatenate the results of all heads to obtain a richer representation for each word.
5. **Output Transformation**: Multiply the concatenated values by a weight matrix to obtain the final multi-head attention output.

## Implementation Overview
- **Number of Heads**: Represented by the lowercase letter 'h', indicating the number of parallel attention computations.
- **Feature Representation**: Each head acts as a different feature, contributing to a richer representation of the input sentence.

## Parallel Computation
- **Efficient Implementation**: While conceptually, each head's computation can be thought of as a loop, in practice, they are computed in parallel.
- **Concurrent Processing**: No head depends on the result of another, enabling parallel computation for efficiency.
# Transformer Network Overview

The transformer network combines self-attention and multi-head attention mechanisms to build a powerful architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation. Here's an overview of how it works:

## Components
1. **Encoder Block**: 
   - Receives word embeddings of input sentence.
   - Utilizes multi-head attention to capture interdependencies between words.
   - Followed by a feed-forward neural network to extract features.
   - Typically repeated N times, with N being around 6.

2. **Decoder Block**:
   - Inputs the start-of-sentence token at the beginning.
   - Utilizes multi-head attention to generate subsequent words in the translation.
   - Each step, the decoder queries the input sentence's encoding to predict the next word.
   - Repeated N times, similar to the encoder block.

## Integration
- **Input Representation**: In addition to word embeddings, positional encodings are added to convey word positions.
- **Residual Connections**: Help propagate positional information throughout the architecture.
- **Normalization Layers**: Similar to batch normalization, aid in learning efficiency.

## Training Process
- **Masked Multi-Head Attention**: During training, the network is trained to predict subsequent words given correct translations.
- **Training vs. Prediction**: During training, the entire correct output sequence is available, allowing for parallel prediction. At test time, predictions are made iteratively.

## Additional Enhancements
- **Positional Encoding**: Utilizes sine and cosine functions to encode word positions.

# Transformer vs RNN: Why Transformers Reign Supreme

This README delves into the superiority of the transformer model over recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing tasks, particularly in the context of neural machine translation.

## The Problem with RNNs

RNNs process inputs sequentially, leading to computational bottlenecks as the sequence length increases. Longer sequences require more sequential steps, amplifying the risk of information loss and vanishing gradients.

## The Rise of Transformers

Transformers, born out of Google's efforts to address RNN limitations, revolutionize NLP with their attention-based architecture. Unlike RNNs, transformers rely solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the sequential processing bottleneck.

## Why Transformers Excel

Transformers offer unparalleled speed and robustness in handling complex contexts, thanks to their parallel computation capabilities and enhanced understanding of context.

# Understanding Transformers: A Brief Overview

Transformers have sparked immense interest and excitement in the field of natural language processing. This README provides a concise overview of the transformer model and its significance.

## Introduction to Transformers

The transformer model, introduced in 2017 by Google researchers, including Lukasz Kaiser, has emerged as the standard architecture for large language models. Notable examples include BERT, T5, and GPT-3, each contributing to the transformative impact of transformers in NLP.

The foundational paper, "Attention is All You Need," lays the groundwork for understanding transformers and serves as the basis for subsequent models explored in this course.

## Core Components of the Transformer Model

At the heart of the transformer model lies scale dot-product attention, a computationally efficient mechanism for capturing relationships between words in a sequence. This attention mechanism enables transformers to scale effectively, utilizing fewer computational resources compared to traditional architectures.

The transformer model employs multi-head attention layers, running in parallel and incorporating learnable linear transformations of input queries, keys, and values. This enables the model to capture complex dependencies within the input sequence.

## Encoder and Decoder Architecture

The transformer architecture consists of an encoder-decoder framework, each comprising multiple layers of attention modules, residual connections, and normalization.

- **Encoder**: Utilizes self-attention to generate contextual representations of input sequences, facilitating effective information capture across all input tokens.

- **Decoder**: Employs masked attention to attend only to previous positions during sequence generation, followed by attention to encoder outputs to ensure coherence between input and output sequences.

## Positional Encoding

Transformers incorporate positional encoding to encode the position of each input token within the sequence. This ensures that word order information is preserved, essential for tasks such as translation.

## Model Architecture

The transformer architecture combines input embeddings, positional encodings, encoder layers, and decoder layers to facilitate parallelized training and efficient computation across multiple GPUs.

## Advantages Over RNNs

Transformers address key limitations of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), including sequential processing bottlenecks and vanishing gradient problems. By leveraging parallel computation and attention mechanisms, transformers offer a promising alternative for processing sequential data in various domains.



## Popular Applications of Transformers in NLP

Transformers have gained prominence in NLP due to their ability to address a wide range of tasks, including:

- **Automatic Text Summarization**: Transformers excel at summarizing lengthy text documents, condensing them into concise summaries.
- **Autocompletion**: They are used to suggest completions for partially typed text, enhancing user experience in various applications.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Transformers can identify and classify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations within text.
- **Automatic Question Answering**: They facilitate the extraction of relevant information from textual data to answer user queries.
- **Machine Translation**: Transformers are deployed for translating text from one language to another, achieving high-quality translations.

## State-of-the-Art Transformer Models

Several transformer models have emerged as state-of-the-art solutions for NLP tasks:

- **GPT (Generative Pre-Training)**: Introduced by OpenAI, GPT models, including GPT-2, leverage transformer architectures for text generation tasks.
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Developed by the Google AI Language team, BERT is renowned for its ability to learn text representations bidirectionally.
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**: Another innovation from Google, T5 is a multitask transformer capable of performing a wide range of NLP tasks.

## Understanding the T5 Model

T5 stands out as a powerful and versatile transformer model capable of performing multiple tasks within a single framework. With T5, a single model can handle tasks such as translation, classification, question answering, regression, and summarization.

### Example Applications with T5:

- **Summarization**: T5 condenses lengthy text documents into concise summaries, preserving key information.




## Overview of Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Scaled dot-product attention is a key operation in transformers, facilitating the calculation of context vectors for each query in a sequence. The mechanism operates as follows:

- **Inputs**: Queries, keys, and values are fed into the attention layer.
- **Outputs**: Context vectors are generated for each query, representing weighted sums of the values based on the similarity between queries and keys.
- **Softmax**: Ensures that the weights assigned to values sum up to 1, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness.
- **Scaling**: Division by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors improves performance.

## Efficiency and Implementation

Scaled dot-product attention is highly efficient, relying solely on matrix multiplication and softmax operations. This simplicity allows for efficient implementation on GPUs or TPUs, accelerating training processes.

To compute the query, key, and value matrices:

- Transform words in sequences into embedding vectors.
- Construct query matrix using embedding vectors for queries.
- Form key matrix by stacking embedding vectors for keys.
- Generate value matrix using the same or transformed vectors as keys.

## Matrix Operations in Scaled Dot-Product Attention

At each time step, the following operations are performed:

1. Compute matrix product between query and transpose of key matrix.
2. Scale product by inverse square root of key vector dimension.
3. Apply softmax to obtain weights matrix.

After computation of the weights matrix:

- Multiply it with the value matrix to obtain context vectors for each query.

## Significance in Transformers

Scaled dot-product attention is the backbone of transformer models, enabling efficient capturing of dependencies in sequences. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it indispensable in various NLP tasks.


## Overview of Attention Mechanisms in Transformers

Transformer models employ various attention mechanisms to capture relationships between words in sequences:

- **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Words in one sequence attend to all words in another sequence, commonly used in translation tasks.
- **Self-Attention**: Queries, keys, and values originate from the same sequence, enabling each word to attend to every other word for contextual representation.
- **Masked Self-Attention**: Similar to self-attention, but queries cannot attend to future positions, ensuring predictions depend only on known outputs.

## Understanding Masked Self-Attention

Masked self-attention is prevalent in decoder layers of transformer models, ensuring that predictions at each position are based only on past information. Here's how it works:

- **Calculation**: Like regular self-attention, masked self-attention involves calculating the softmax of scaled products between queries and the transpose of the key matrix.
- **Mask Matrix**: A mask matrix is added within the softmax, containing zeros except for positions above the diagonal, set to negative infinity or a very large negative number.
- **Effect**: This mask ensures that queries cannot attend to future positions, preventing information leakage from future tokens.
- **Context Generation**: After applying the softmax with the mask, the weights matrix is multiplied by the value matrix to obtain context vectors for each query.

## Importance of Masked Self-Attention

Masked self-attention plays a crucial role in transformer decoder layers, allowing for the generation of predictions based only on past information. This mechanism ensures coherence in sequence generation tasks such as language translation.

## Intuition behind Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention enhances the capability of transformer models by allowing them to capture multiple relationships between words simultaneously. Here's how it works:

- **Parallel Attention**: Instead of applying attention to a single set of query, key, and value matrices, multi-head attention applies attention mechanisms in parallel to multiple sets.
- **Number of Heads**: The number of times attention is applied equals the number of heads in the model. Each head utilizes a different set of representations for queries, keys, and values.
- **Linear Transformations**: Different sets of representations are obtained by linearly transforming the original embeddings using separate sets of matrices for each head.

## Mathematical Operations in Multi-Head Attention

The process of multi-head attention involves the following steps:

1. **Transformation**: Each input matrix (queries, keys, and values) is transformed into multiple vector spaces, corresponding to the number of heads in the model.
2. **Attention Mechanism**: Scaled dot-product attention is applied independently to each set of transformed matrices.
3. **Concatenation**: The results from each attention head are concatenated horizontally into a single matrix.
4. **Linear Transformation**: The concatenated matrix is linearly transformed to obtain the output context vectors.

## Parameter Matrices and Dimensions

Understanding the dimensions of parameter matrices involved in multi-head attention is crucial:

- **Transformation Matrices**: Each linear transformation contains learnable parameters, determining the dimensions of the transformed matrices.
- **Choice of Sizes**: The dimensions (d_sub_K and d_sub_V) of the transformation matrices can be chosen based on the embedding size and the number of heads in the model.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Proper choice of sizes ensures that the computational cost of multi-head attention remains comparable to single-head attention.

## Implementation and Parallel Computing

Multi-head attention allows for efficient parallel computing, enhancing the performance of transformer models. By implementing multi-head attention, computations can be performed in parallel while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Understanding Transformer Decoder Structure

The transformer decoder follows a simple yet powerful structure:

1. **Input Encoding**: Tokenized sentences are embedded using word embeddings, and positional encodings are added to represent the position of each word in the sequence.
2. **Multi-Headed Attention**: The positional input embeddings undergo multi-headed attention, where each word attends to other positions in the sequence to capture relationships.
3. **Feed-Forward Layers**: After attention, each word passes through a feed-forward layer, introducing non-linear transformations.
4. **Residual Connections**: Residual connections are added around each layer of attention and feed-forward layers to aid in training speed and reduce processing time.
5. **Layer Normalization**: Normalization steps are applied after each layer to speed up training and enhance efficiency.
6. **Repetition**: The decoder block, consisting of attention and feed-forward layers, is repeated N times to capture complex relationships within the sequence.
7. **Final Output**: The output of the decoder layer is passed through a fully connected layer to obtain tensors representing the probabilities of each word in the vocabulary.

## Implementation Details

Here's a breakdown of the implementation details:

- **Tokenized Input**: Tokenized sentences are embedded and augmented with positional encodings.
- **Multi-Headed Attention**: Each word attends to other positions in the sequence, weighted by their importance.
- **Feed-Forward Layers**: Non-linear transformations are introduced via fully connected feed-forward layers.
- **Residual Connections**: Residual connections speed up training and enhance efficiency.
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalization steps ensure stable training and improved convergence.
- **Repetition**: The decoder block is repeated N times to capture intricate relationships.
- **Final Output**: The output is passed through a fully connected layer and softmax for cross-entropy loss calculation.

# Transformer Summarizer

## Understanding the Problem

The task at hand is summarization, where the goal is to produce a concise summary of whole news articles. This is achieved using the transformer model, which is well-suited for text generation tasks.

## Data Processing for Summarization

To prepare the data for training the transformer model, the input features are constructed by concatenating the article with the summary. This concatenated text is tokenized into integers, with special tags denoting padding and end-of-sequence (EOS).

## Weighted Loss for Training

During training, a weighted loss function is used to focus the model's attention on the summary portion of the input. This helps the model learn to generate summaries effectively. Additionally, a weighted cross-entropy function is optimized, ignoring words from the article to be summarized.

## Making Inferences with the Model

At test or inference time, the trained model is used to generate summaries. The article is inputted to the model with an EOS token, and the model predicts the next word, iteratively generating the summary until it encounters another EOS token.
